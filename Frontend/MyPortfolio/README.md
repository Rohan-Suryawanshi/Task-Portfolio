## Prerequisites

### Install Node.js and npm

Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed. You can verify this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Steps to Run the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rohan-Suryawanshi/Task-Portfolio.git
```
## 2.Go to Directory

```bash
cd Frontend/MyPortfolio
```

## 3.Install Project Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## 4. Run the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server. Run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the React development server and open the project in your default web browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.
